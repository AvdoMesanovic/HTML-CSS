Website Ideas:
Make the home page the top five aircrafts based on user votes
Make a table for each supported aircraft, which can be swapped with the picture or vice versa
Make the gallery have one aircraft per page, then you can pull a different one up and have the other one dissappear
Make a specs tab that is one large chart with the basics (max alt, max speed, thrust, cost, year, etc) for all the aircrafts supported
